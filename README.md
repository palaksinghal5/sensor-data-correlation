# :star: Sensor Data : Understanding Correlations.
## Human Activity Recognition using mobile sensor data.

Classifying different human activities on the basis of the data collected from the sensors packed into our devices. 

<br>
**DEPENDENCIES**
* panda
* numpy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* sklearn
<br>

Introduction:
-------------

For every Smartphone we can find out a variety of sensors we are focusing on two of them that are Gyroscope and Accelerometer.
<br>
Using Sensors the data has been recorded.
<br>
This can be termed as a 6 class classification problem as for detecting we will be having six activities.<br>

Dataset:
--------

The dataset for the following problem can be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip#)
<br>
Human Activity Recognition database is built from the recordings of 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone on the waist. 
<br><br>
**Activities**
* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

[**Accelerometers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration, as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes)
<br><br>
[**GyroScope**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope) maintains orientation along a axis so that the orientation is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.
